Welcome to Toonybot's Pizzeria and Funhouse! Established in July of 2014, we are a local pizzeria chain with the main goal of entertaining young children. We have 2 animatronics, one is Toonybot and another is a animatronic named Tammy. We are looking for a security guard to help monitor the place, to make sure no one tries to come in and steal the animatronics during the night. We have gotten reports that the animatronics somehow move during the night, but we're not too sure if we can prove that. That's why we need you to help us! Call our phone number if you'd like to apply for a job.
