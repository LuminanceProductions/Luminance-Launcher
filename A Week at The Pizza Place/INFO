A Week at the Pizza Palace is a fan-made reimagining of the original FNAF game, which puts the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizza into a brand new Chuck E Cheese/Pizza Time Theater inspired setting. The game is also based off 2015 old fangames, such as Leon Rymer's "Five Nights at Chuck E Cheese's" or FreddyFredbear's "Freddy's Wonderland".
